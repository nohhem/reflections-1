What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository Git creates a repository in the current directory.
You initialize a repository to track changes in the files which this directory contains.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is different because it is fluid. We can add or remove files from staging area until we are sure that we can commit those files to repository.
It offers flexibility, we can rethink changes before committing them.
